Macgill Davis

NOTE: I did not want to overwrite my macgill4444.github.io page because I am using it as a personal website so I posted this lab at:

macgill4444.github.io/mmap

All of my commits have been to that repo on Github so you can see I have been committing regularly if you would like.


1. I believe that everything has been implemented correctly although the map loads slowly on my computer (especially with the polylines).

2. I have not collaborated with anyone but I have borrowed a decent amount of code from Ming's examples.

3. 6 hours
