What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
	- I really enjoyed this class. I took it in tandem with security which I believed enhanced my experience in both classes.
	
What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	- I liked working with Node.js. I learned a lot about JavaScript and how great (and difficult) working with asynchronous languages can be.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	- I have grown A LOT and I understand a ton more about web programming now than I did at the beginning of the semester.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	- I learned how the web works and how frontend interacts with backend. I am interning for a web dev company next semester and I could not have gotten the job it with this class. I feel like I have the ability to start building a lot of my own cool projects. I think I took a lead on the final project and I feel like I am really understanding rails.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	- I want to keep building web apps, especially mobile responsive. I eventually want to learn to build an app too and the server that the app talks to.
